# Arena-Survial

'Arena Survival' is a short platformer I created in spring of 2022. The objective of the game is to survive in an arena for as long as possible, while 
avoiding enemies and traps that spawn once the player has reached a certain score.

The game was created in python with pygame and the use of multiple built-in python libraries. No external resources were utilized outside of pygame, making 
the game playable without any additional downloads or modules.

Controls and gameplay instructions are explained in the 'objective' screen of the game. If you are interested in how the game works, The code is separated 
into sections and commented throughout.

This is my longest project to this date, and the code could certainly be optimized and cleaned up further, but I am happy with it in its current state.

Enjoy the game!
